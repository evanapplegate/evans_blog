<h3>Have you heard about our painfully loud speaker as a service?</h3>

<p>Remember "LRAD"? You pointed it at clumps of people in a crowd, and it threw vague "energy" at them, making it so painful to remain there that they’d flee? Something Radley Balko would’ve shown you in 2012? <a href="https://newatlas.com/lrad-long-range-acoustic-device/11433/">It was made by American Technology Corp.?</a></p>

<p>Now they don’t sell "directed energy crowd control device" but "very loud relatively precise steerable speaker," i.e., "the old thing but cranked down".</p>

<p>Compare this <a href="https://genasys.com/investor-relations/">mild website that looks like it’s selling enterprise timekeeping</a></p>

<p>An actual "design artifact," the very gentle Athletic Greens-colored website selling a (specifically) painfully loud speaker, as seen at the end of this post in its mildest use</p>

<h3>"COVID Response" Was Hands-Down The Craziest Thing That Had Happened In My Life</h3>
<p>Everyone in 2019 would have thought it real weird to dissolve Christmas, Thanksgiving, weddings, etc., plans for at least 350 million people at once because there’s some contagious respiratory disease? And per CDC half of its victims were over 75?</p>

<p>Large-scale commerce never hindered, sub-1k-employer companies shuttered, thanksgivings, dates, birthday parties, Christmases, family dinners prohibited.</p>

<p>Every COVID-control public health intervention, from the scale of "within the 4 walls of this nursing home room" to "international border checkpoint" was worse than useless in 2021 and it’s worse than useless today. All of it. COVID was never bad enough to justify any of the anti-human mitigation measures inflicted by "public health officials" against normal people who wanted more than bare life.</p>

<p>First: public health officials, before 2020 I thought they were just Excel wranglers only trusted to edit copy on "drink less soda" posters (great job guys, <a href="https://sci-hub.st/https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30484738/">4 out of 5 of Americans have broken metabolisms</a>), but now I have to treat them all as dangerous morons. If they were any good at managing human disease, they’d be clinicians or researchers, and if they were any good at stats they’d be prop traders or sports gamblers, but they’re not?</p>

<p>Heads of hospital systems and counties and airports let these ggplot-hustlers provide inputs on real decisions??? They made old people die with only iPads as companions because they had a respiratory disease???? That was monstrous and not one "public health official" lost their job for it.</p>

<p>Gramma’s memory care unit is currently on strict COVID protocol; her daughter, thankfully, immediately took her home. They make sad 80-year-olds wear a mask, eat cafeteria meals away from each other, and canceled activities, but also wouldn’t open the windows. So they punish demented elderly with isolation while taking no effective measure against an airborne respiratory virus?</p>

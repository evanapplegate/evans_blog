<p>Effacing features is a rush. The "critical cartographers" have one good point they bury in recondite academese: the mapmaker has absurd power.</p>

Just seeing the tiny smudge of roads on the map surfaces memories...the creaky springs on the dry goods shop door...the proprietor's old dog splayed in the doorway, indifferent to traffic...</p>

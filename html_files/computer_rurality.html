<h3>Get Me Some Computer Rurality</h3>
<p>I required:</p>

<ol>
<li><em>Ad libitum</em> direct sunlight while I worked.</em></li>
<li>The biggest jars for jarring. No, bigger.</li>
<li>An ankle-high garden, a waist-high garden, a head-high garden, and a ladder-high garden.</li>
<li>1x twisty oak.</li>
<li><em>Ad libitum</em> Family Guy compilations on my laptop.</li>
</ol>

<p>Computer rurality, enabled by rural-access high-speed internet via satellite or cell tower or line-of-sight relay, was the most fun way to be a "gentleman farmer."</p>

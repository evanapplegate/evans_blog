<p><a href="https://daniellebaskin.com/">Baskin</a> is my fav commercial artist/artistic merchant. In 2019 she gave me advice on selling glowing maps, and I got to see her garage-apartment-studio out of which she sold:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Pluto tapestries (New Horizons composite) run off an enormous printer</li>
    <li>Stunning hand-painted bicycle helmets; landscapes!</li>
    <li>Corpo-branded fruit for event giveaways; tech company logo on a mango? So much better than a tee</li>
    <li>Dialup, a Bloomberg Beta-funded app that called you a few times a day with "a random stranger wants to talk to you on the phone." That’s it. No avatars, no DMs. Lotta lonely olds. I loved it, the first social network that nerfed hot people. And only one guy wanted to tell me about his impending suicide.
        <ul>
            <li>Also, she wrote a thread with the gist of "Video calls suck ass, what was wrong with the conference call?" and she’s 100% right. Camera off for life</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ol>

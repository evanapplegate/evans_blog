<h3>What I've Learned During 13 Years of Mapmaking</h3>

<ol>
  <li>You're not smarter than time. No reinventing wheels because you're not that good.</li>
  <li>Just ask. You see a nice map, you see the mapmaker is alive, and you ask them how it happened. You might have a great conversation and find out.</li>
  <li>If a map needs to look nice, divide work in a grid; each grid cell is your atomic unit of work.</li>
  <li>Learn about everything else but maps, then use that to make maps. Maps are for the world, not the world for maps.</li>

# Image Example Post

This is how to include images in your posts.

![Sample image description](/images/sample.jpg)

You can also resize images with HTML:

<img src="/images/sample.jpg" alt="Sample image with custom size" width="500">

For multiple images:

![First image](/images/first.jpg)
![Second image](/images/second.jpg)

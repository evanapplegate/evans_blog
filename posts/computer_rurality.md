# Get me some computer rurality

I required:

1. *Ad libitum* direct sunlight while I worked.
2. The biggest jars for jarring. No, bigger.
3. An ankle-high garden, a waist-high garden, a head-high garden, and a ladder-high garden.
4. 1x twisty oak.
5. *Ad libitum* Family Guy compilations on my laptop.

Computer rurality, enabled by rural-access high-speed internet via satellite or cell tower or line-of-sight relay, seemed like the most fun way to be a "gentleman farmer."

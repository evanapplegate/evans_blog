# Get Me Some Computer Rurality

I required:


1. *Ad libitum* direct sunlight while I worked.

1. The biggest jars for jarring. No, bigger.

1. An ankle-high garden, a waist-high garden, a head-high garden, and a ladder-high garden.

1. 1x twisty oak.

1. *Ad libitum* Family Guy compilations on my laptop.

Computer rurality, enabled by rural-access high-speed internet via satellite or cell tower or line-of-sight relay, was the most fun way to be a "gentleman farmer."

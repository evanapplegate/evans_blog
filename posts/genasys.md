# Have you heard about our painfully loud speaker as a service?

Remember "LRAD"? You pointed it at clumps of people in a crowd, and it threw vague "energy" at them, making it so painful to remain there that they’d flee? Something Radley Balko would’ve shown you in 2012? [It was made by American Technology Corp.?](https://newatlas.com/lrad-long-range-acoustic-device/11433/)


Now they don’t sell "directed energy crowd control device" but "very loud relatively precise steerable speaker," i.e., "the old thing but cranked down".


Compare this [mild website that looks like it’s selling enterprise timekeeping](https://genasys.com/investor-relations/)


An actual "design artifact," the very gentle Athletic Greens-colored website selling a (specifically) painfully loud speaker, as seen at the end of this post in its mildest use

# The soft end of something sharp

There was an insane gulf between the status of the "bedside nurse" and the "hospital doctor."

The nurse determined who felt like total dogshit and lived in a space station among scratchy fabrics for longer than necessary, and who did not.

A good nurse effected direct, human care towards their charges; they determined whether you were reclining in liquid shit or just tired and annoyed by beeps.

You were permitted to leave the hospital when a few blood assays match their ref ranges and a doctor signs off on your improved condition. You don't get to leave until you feel better.

The doctor wasn't the sharp end of the "feeling better" thing. When you pushed the call button the doctor was never the first one through your door. The doctor used the computer, typed, called, used their Training and Experience to push buttons to put meds in you, metal in you, kV of electricity to get high-energy-emitter images of you. It's not as creative as it once was, since The Medical Record was their master, so they got no points for success if the boxes prescribed by The Medical Record were not ticked. "Standard of care."

That wasn't as hard as crevice work. It's an annoying stressful white collar job in a terribly-lit office, for sure. But I wouldn't say it's harder than nursing.

Priors: I'm biased against American hospital medicine, what an ugly workplace inflicting expensive things on pretty much everyone you know, bound up by cruel regs. Also only serial, documentable, documented someone-dies negligence or malice will get anyone fired.
